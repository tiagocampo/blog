# Introduction

Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to decompose a multivariate dataset in a set of successive orthogonal components that explain a maximum amount of the variance. 

The goal in reducing dimensionality is to decrease the complexity of the data, since a machine learning model applied to a dataset with a large number of features is more prone to over fitting. 

I'll not discuss the inner mathematical workings of PCA, but merely provide a snipped on how to use it in a machine learning workflow using sklearn.

# Workflow

Starting by importing libraries and dataset

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

dataset = pd.read_csv('Wine.csv')
X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values
y = dataset.iloc[:, -1].values
```

Them split dataset into train and test sets

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 0)
```

An important step is to standardize the features

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
sc = StandardScaler()
X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = sc.transform(X_test)
```

Then we apply PCA

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
pca = PCA(n_components = 2)
X_train = pca.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = pca.transform(X_test)
```

In this snipped we used `n_components = 2`, but in general the number of components is a tunning parameter.

With the desired components, we proceed to the training/testing and accuracy calculations

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
classifier = LogisticRegression(random_state = 0)
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score
y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print(cm)
accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
```

Thats all!
